Corner Intersect BUG (FIXED)

M's Solution:
Check if intersecting with corner by using pointBallIntersect().
IF we are, figure out which edge is closer(?) to the center of the ball.
Then bounce off that edge.

T's Solution:
Check if intersecting with corner by using pointBallIntersect().
If it is, run a special cornerBounce() function that purposefully bounces the ball out of the rectangle.
You could even use the, as of yet, unwritten ballBounce() function in conjunction with the imaginary ball.


Shallow Angle BUG (MAYBE FIXED)
(Suspect it comes from variable refresh/frame rate)


Multiple Bounces BUG (FIXED)

M's Solution 1:
Add a cool down period after a bounce.

M's Solution 2:
Displace the ball out of the rect when it collides


Odd number of Balls BUG (FIXED)
(Suspect it has to do with gameObjects list and the order objects get compared in detectCollisions())


Paddle moving into Ball BUG (FIXED)

M's Solution:
Similer to Multiple Bounces Solution 2, move ball out of rectangle when they collide.

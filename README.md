### TODO

- Add testing page & update createWorld() to make use of this
- Test different ball angles
- Increase ball speed
- Add speed property to ball?
- Change ballBounce() to give more random angles
- Look into canvas scaling with window
- Ball bounces are effected by Paddle movement
- Paddle bound to zone
- Add color property to game object constructor
- Expose color changing for all classes 
- Scoring Zone
- Scoreboard
- Solo version where I bounce against wall
- Two player local
- Arbitrary number of player field generation
- Draw from center of canvas/window versus top left?
- _Probably new TODO at this point_ Online Multiplayer
- BUG with shallow angle bounce (probably because of variable framerate)
